<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>Back to Erathia is a virtual card based rpg game that is built on Metis. It was inspired by the greatest game of the history of mankind: Heroes of Might and Magic III. In this game the trading cards, Heroes, Creatures and Artifacts are represented as NFTs. The main function of the game is to use the owned BTE NFT cards in a scenario against computer or human opponents and to mint sell and buy trading cards.<br />This platform allows users to gather unique cards and trade with other players. It provides the transfer of digital assets and the right of ownership to the users. The trading cards will be able to be traded in upcoming NFT marketplaces on Andromeda mainnet.</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<p>Players can enter the game with minimum one BTE Primary or Secondary Hero. The player controls the Hero from an overhead perspective and navigates him throughout the continent of Erathia in a quest to conquer and rule them all.</p>
<p>The game consist of <strong>five</strong> basic screens:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Erathia overworld, in which the player navigates the character;</li>
<li>a side-view battle screen;</li>
<li>the Tavern where players can mint Secondary Heroes and Secondary Characters;</li>
<li>the Marketplace where Heroes, Creatures, Artifacts and Regions can be traded;</li>
<li>and a menu interface, in which the player can see his or her Hero, the army of Creatures, the artifacts, the Regions or the gameplay settings.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The player can use their Hero to battle other armies (AI or other players). If the player holds BTE Creatures and/or BTE Artifacts they strenghten the force of their army.</p>
<p>When the player encounters a group of monster or is challenged by a another player, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the two engaged army.</p>
<p>During a battle, the player may choose to fight using attack or magic or attempt to flee; however, fleeing is not possible in player-to-player battle. The army have hit points (HP); when the army's HP is reduced to zero hte player gets defeated and the battle is over. Once the player's army won, the player's Hero that were involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Hero will level up. A Hero's level controls its attributes, such as the attack, defense, knowledge and spell power. <br />Such changes are represented on the blockchain itself and with each level up of a Hero the new level and attributes are shown accordingly on the NFT. (This is possible since all NFT metadata stored on-chain for BTE Hero collection)</p>
<p>Receiving bonus Secondary Creatures and Artifacts is another essential element of the gameplay to reward frequent player. While fighting and defeating a group of monster, the player may win the defeated Secondary Creature or a random Artifact which will come under the player's ownership. Factors in the success rate of winning such reward include the playtime of the Player and the amount of BTE Gold they are holding.</p>
<p>Only Players with BTE Primary Heroes NFTs can mint BTE Secondary Heroes NFTs and with BTE Primary Creatures NFTs can mint BTE Secondary Creatures NFTs in the Tavern using BTE Gold Token. The minted NFTs are shown in the Player's wallet once the transaction is completed on the blockchain.</p>
